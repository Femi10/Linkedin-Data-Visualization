1) If most of your staff or the set of staff you are targeting are semi-skilled or Junior, such that food will be enough reason for them to abandon other responsiblities that makes them come late. 

2) If you have proven that your staff are actually people who places high premium on meals. 

For me, considering that the company is in Lagos,  I would recommend providing a staff bus."

A lot of HR people have slandered me for saying that most often than not, bad HR practice is only a symptom of the problem, and the real problem is bad leadership. An organization cannot and will not get more value than they expect from and permit their HR unit to deliver.

A company with great leadership will set high ethical and professional standards for their HR and recruit the type of HR professional that can help attain these standards, else they train or replace them. 

In a nutshell, the solution provided by HR reflects what leadership expects of them.

In order words, traditional work arrangement doesn't respect the official work hours, so i won't expect otherwise in remote work arrangement. 

As a matter of fact, i believe where possible, while establishing an official work hour on paper, remote work should allow for more flexible work structure and timing. Some people are usually more productive at certain times, so if their work doesn't require them to be at their desk at a certain time, then judge them on their productivity and performance and not time they choose to work."

However, I do not quite agree with the ‚ÄúUse and Dump phrase‚Äù 

Mentorship is a noble role for the mentor and voluntary relationship for both. They both are trying to satisfy a need, and are absolutely free to diplomatically disconnect from the relationship anytime they deem fit, most especially when the purpose of the relationship has been met with no hard feelings on the part of any.  

Saying the mentor has been used somehow makes it feels like the mentor is expectant of a reward or feels entitled to the mentee. 

As a mentor, if you are discouraged about mentoring others because previous mentees disconnected after you had helped them achieve their goals, then you need to check what your driving forces are or your self esteem or both. 

Note: I maintain very good relationship with my mentors, that‚Äôs my personal style. But not every one would do that, not every of my mentee does that, and I have no issues."

In my opinion, i think business and HR leaders needs to see talent mobility as an inherent risk associated with the doing business - the same way they experience and confront risk associated with change in demand and global economic disruption. 

Let‚Äôs look at it this way, a brand can spend millions of Dollars developing a product/service only to release the product to find out their competition has or is about to launch an advanced version of their product or service.  What they simply do is rejig their R&D team for another round of innovation.

Similarly, in spite of the revenue allotted to employee experience and engagement, companies should plan for the risk of their imminent departure, even sooner than predicted.

I am at a loss on how summarize my story with regards to internet. 

For Linkedin; a platform many of my ally (Fresh Graduates) refused to join because they felt it is meant for only professionals, gave me my first job shortly after joining and has set me on a career path of my dream. 

Some of the information and knowledge I have acquired on Linkedin are ones i may not acquire in a two years professional experience. 

Most Importantly for me and i quote you ""It (Linkedin) allows me to see what my old colleagues are up in their careers"" I get mentor-ship from older colleagues even without their notice just by seeing their career summary & movement, academic background & qualification, job descriptions & achievement amongst other things. This gives me a clearer picture of where i am headed and reinforces my desire to achieve much more than they did."

I will also ask you a question that drives me closer to my point. Who would you hold responsible if a moving car splashes dirty rain water on you? The driver of the car or road Maintenance Agency? I can imagine what your answer will be.

My point is this: aside bad road which is beyond the control of car owners, there are other factors that makes a car road unworthy that are within the control of car owner.

I am therefore saying that all road unworthy cars should not use the excuse of bad road as a justification to operate.

Aside been a breach of confidentiality, it shows poor judgement on the side of the recruiter, recruiters should be able to decipher the relative worth of candidates and salaries should be based on value they can add not what they earn in their previous place of work."

Ideally, candidates should receive feedback on outcomes of their assessment, but for obvious reasons; that is not the case in Nigeria. CIPM as a matter of urgency should update their curriculum to include and  emphasize the importance of feedback to unsuccessful candidates."

I believe aside from staying with their wives when in labour and eventually delivers, men don't really do anything of note going forward, most often than not, men will see this period as an opportunity to rest rather than to support their wives, most will leave their wives to do all the chores, babysitting and what have you. Besides, Women are more knowledgeable in taking care of babies, the presence of a man makes little impact - My opinion."

I will explain by using this quote ""The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why"" -Mark Twain.

Everybody has a talent, unique purpose and a calling, it is sometimes difficult to decipher this purpose but i have found out from the track record of great people that the only way to be SUSTAINABLY fulfilled and satisfied is to discover your purpose, engage in and build a career around it, money and other material benefits in your job will only bring satisfaction that can't stand the test of time. That is, it might be difficult if not impossible to get more from your job if that job isn't aligned with your purpose.  

I suggest the best solution is to discover your purpose, which will help you to redefine your career path, Ask yourself this basic question:  

1. What do i enjoy doing? 
2. What do i do without getting tired? 
3. What are the things i can do even without getting a pay? 
4. What do i do so well that everybody commends?  

However, in the process of changing your current job or career for a career that is aligned to your purpose or interest you might not get the expected financial incentive at first, (passion drives you during this period) but eventually money will come."
